In this assignment we shall build a Task Management System that emulate the Kanban approach. A kanban 
board is an agile project management tool designed to help visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and 
maximize efficiency (or flow). It can help both Agile and DevOps teams establish order in their daily work. 
Kanban boards use cards, columns, and continuous improvement to help technology and service teams 
commit to the right amount of work, and get it done! Please refer to the following URL for more info.
